Welcome to my Weather Forecaster! 

## Description
Keeping track of most work days that are filled with many events and activities can be stressful. This application helps keep track of activites that are happening every hour during a 9am - 5pm business day.

Below I'm showing how the Weather Forecaster App looks and functions. The first example is how the page looks on first load. The search areas are empty since there is no saved schedule information. Saving the schedule is done by clicking the blue save button at the end of the rows. The text areas changed color based on the time of day. Grey is past activities, red is current and green is in the future. At the bottom is a red 'Clear Day' button that will clear out any stored schedule information.

1. Example of an empty search page.
